IntStream is a specialized stream in Java for handling primitive int values. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
methods::
-------

range(int startInclusive, int endExclusive): Creates an ordered stream of int values starting from startInclusive (inclusive) up to endExclusive (exclusive).

rangeClosed(int startInclusive, int endInclusive): Similar to range, but the endInclusive value is included in the stream.

of(int... values): Creates an IntStream from an array of int values.

forEach(IntConsumer action): Performs an action for each element in the stream.

mapToInt(IntUnaryOperator mapper): Transforms each element in the stream using the provided mapper.

sum(): Computes the sum of all elements in the stream.

average(): Computes the average of all elements in the stream as an OptionalDouble.

min(): Finds the minimum element in the stream as an OptionalInt.

max(): Finds the maximum element in the stream as an OptionalInt.

count(): Returns the count of elements in the stream as a long.

distinct(): Returns a stream consisting of distinct elements in the same order as the original.

filter(IntPredicate predicate): Filters the stream based on a predicate.

sorted(): Sorts the elements in natural order.

boxed(): Converts the IntStream to a regular Stream<Integer>.

toArray(): Converts the IntStream into an array of int values.

reduce(int identity, IntBinaryOperator op): Performs a reduction on the elements in the stream using the given identity value and operator.

anyMatch(IntPredicate predicate): Returns true if any element in the stream matches the given predicate.

allMatch(IntPredicate predicate): Returns true if all elements in the stream match the given predicate.

noneMatch(IntPredicate predicate): Returns true if none of the elements in the stream match the given predicate.

findFirst(): Returns an OptionalInt containing the first element in the stream.

limit(long maxSize): Limits the stream to at most maxSize elements.

skip(long n): Skips the first n elements in the stream.
